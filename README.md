# N Perlin Noise

### A robust open source implementation of Perlin Noise Algorithm for N-Dimensions in Python.
- A powerful and fast API for n-dimensional noise.
- Easy hyper-parameters selection of octaves, lacunarity and persistence
  as well has complex and customizable hyper-parameters for n-dimension
  frequency, waveLength, warp(interpolation) and range.
- Includes various helpful tools for noise generation and for procedural generation tasks
  such as customizable Gradient, Warp classes.
- Implements custom PRNG generator for n-dimension and can be easily tuned.
